# Designer

[The Designer](https://designer.freenit.org/) is intended to make transition
from idea to implementation easier. You can drag components from the left pane
to the preview in the middle or the component tree on the right pane to add
them to the DOM tree. `Save` button will save current design in .json format so
you can load it with `Load` button later. Export will generate Svelte file with
code corresponding to that design. Freenit uses chota for CSS, so theming is easy,
using CSS variables. Icons are provided via `@mdi/js` library.
