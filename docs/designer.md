# Designer
[The Designer](https://designer.freenit.org/) is intended to make transition 
from idea to implementation easier. You can drag components from the left pane
to the preview in the middle or the component tree on the right pane to add 
them to the DOM tree. `Save` button will save current design in .json format so 
you can load it with `Load` button later. Export will generate .js file with 
code coresponding to that design.
