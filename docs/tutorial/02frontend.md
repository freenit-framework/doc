# UI and Store

## UI

For start, let's get the code and save it in the right place. When you click on
`Export` button, you'll get `page.svelte`. Move that file into
`myproject/services/frontend/src/routes/blog/+page.svelte`. After that, run
`npm run format` to make the code formatted better.


## Store

The store is where you'll keep your reactive data. That is, when that data
changes, store is smart enough to update the UI.
